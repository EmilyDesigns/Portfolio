            Hello, my name is Emily A. Llauro and I am currently enrolled as a student at F.I.R.S.T. Institute.<br>
            In July of 2022, I will graduate with my diploma in Graphic Design and Web Development.<br>
            After graduation, I hope to combine my skills of illustration and graphic design to create <br>book covers, posters, and other various items.<br>
            <br>
            When I was a child, I participated in traditional drawing classes which sparked my desire to <br>pursue art;
            however, I am almost entirely self-taught. I have always had a passion for creating <br>illustrations that I look forward to sharing with everyone.<br>
            <br>
            In the future, I hope to use the experience I have gained to continue creating professional <br>illustrations and graphic design projects including
            manga covers and anime posters. <br>Since I have a great interest in anime, I want to contribute to promoting the growth of new <br>anime and manga with
            their merchandise and campaigns.
